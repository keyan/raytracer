# raytracer

Basic ray tracer, only supports rendering spheres.

Implemented through following [Peter Shirley's great book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B5AODD8). It is now free online too, but I'm linking to the ebook because it is a great resource and you should support him if you can.

That book is great, but to really understand the methods being additional references were required, namely:
- http://www.scratchapixel.com, specifically their [ray tracing introduction](http://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/introduction-to-ray-tracing)
- Andrew Kensler's famous [business card ray tracer analysis](http://eastfarthing.com/blog/2016-01-12-card/)
- And Fabien Sanglard's [analysis of the same code](http://fabiensanglard.net/rayTracing_back_of_business_card/)
- Occasional cross referencing with [Fundamentals of Computer Graphics](https://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Computer-Graphics-Peter-Shirley/dp/1568814690), also by Peter Shirley
